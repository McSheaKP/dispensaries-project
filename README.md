## Dispensary Project

### Introduction

Welcome! We're thrilled that you're considering joining our team. To showcase your skills, we invite you to build an
innovative application using the dataset provided below. This README.md outlines the expectations and requirements for
your project.

### Your Challenge: Dispensary Application

Your task is to create a meaningful application utilizing the provided dataset. Your application should address a
real-world problem or offer a useful feature related to dispensaries. The dataset includes extensive metadata on
dispensaries along with their menus. Integrate as much of this data as possible to enhance your application's
functionality.

Bonus points will be awarded for incorporating additional data via APIs or downloadable datasets.

Feel free to use any language or framework for this project. While we embrace a diverse set of technologies, most (
web-based) applications developed by Headset leverage the latest version of Angular and TypeScript.

### Data Access

You have two options to access the dataset:

- Local File Access: A file named dispensaries.json is included in the repository, containing a comprehensive dataset of
  dispensaries along with metadata and menu items.
- Database Access: If you prefer to demonstrate your API and database skills, we can provide credentials to a MongoDB
  instance containing the dataset. Contact us if you choose this option.
